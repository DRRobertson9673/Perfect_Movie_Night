# Perfect_Movie_Night

## Description

This group project involves the creation of the "Perfect Movie Night" App. 

The application retrieves all the movie/TV show options from numerous streaming platforms that satisfy the user's preferences, and displays them in one place. This allows users to easily decide what movies or TV shows to watch, without having to hop from one platform to the other or scroll through hundreds of alternatives. 

The application was built to run in the browser, constructed using Bootstrap for responsiveness and a polished UI, makes use of two server-side APIs, uses modals instead of alerts, confirms or prompts, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery.


## Installation

The application, linked below, was deployed using GitHub Pages. 

Simply upload the index.html, watchlist.html and license.txt files, along with the JS, CSS and image folders, to the desired webserver.

## Usage

The application can be accessed via an internet browser.

The application gives users a choice of streaming platforms, which can be chosen by clicking the desired button. Next, the user can decide between "Movies" or "Series" (the default is "Movies") through a toggle switch. Lastly, the user can choose the desired genre from a dropdown list (default is set to "All genres").

When they click the "Search" button, the options relating to their preferences are displayed, as shown above.

When the user clicks on any of the posters, a modal pops up with further information about the movie/series, and the option to add it to a watchlist.

On the watchlist, the user can view what they have saved previously. A modal pops up when any poster is clicked with more information and the option to remove the movie/series from the watchlist. There are also buttons to clear the entire watchlist and to navigate back to the main search page.
