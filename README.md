# Perfect_Movie_Night

## Description
As a user, I want to be able to:
Choose a streaming platform, type and genre, so that I can quickly get recommendations for what movies/tv shows to watch
Click on a movie/show poster, so that I can get more information about that movie/show
Add movies and shows to a watchlist, so that I can save the things I would like to watch later
Access movies/shows I previously saved even after refreshing the watchlist page
Remove movies/shows from my watchlist, or clear all at once
